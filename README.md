# CS-585-Natural-Language-Processing

An introduction to the problems of computing with human languages. Parsing. Semantic representations. Text generation. Lexicography. Discourse. Sublanguage studies. Applications to CAI, database interfaces and information retrieval.

# Overview
This course is about how to build systems that analyze unstructured natural language texts and extract useful information
from them. Students should expect to gain familiarity with the most common types of natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, including text classification, sequence labeling, and structure predictionâ€”and to learn appropriate frameworks for
performing these tasks. The course will cover the technical methodology in sufficient detail to allow students to apply these
frameworks in an informed way, and to make current research accessible.
